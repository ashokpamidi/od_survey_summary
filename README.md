This repository contains all the scrips and sample data used to develope OD Summary Web App. You can find the app [here](https://sd19vs-satya-pamidi.shinyapps.io/OD_data_Summary_report/?_ga=2.233031390.1563644294.1672725459-463086929.1672136546)

It is still work in progress. Since edge cases were not explored properly it may through errors if you misspell column names or sheet names.
